# DiceMix Light

DiceMix Light is a cryptographic P2P mixing protocol. It enables a group of mutually distrusting
peers, each of them holding an input message of identical size, to agree on the set of their input
messages anonymously, i.e., without revealing the which peer sends which input message. The
protocol provides this functionality without the help of a trusted proxy, and succeeds even in the
presence of malicious peers trying to prevent the honest peers from completing the protocol.

DiceMix Light is inspired by [DiceMix][dicemix], an P2P mixing protocol optimized for a minimal
number of communications rounds and require 4+2f communication rounds in the presence of f
disrupting peers. DiceMix Light needs 4+3f communication rounds but requires far less computation
and is simpler. We refer to the [DiceMix paper][dicemix] for background on P2P mixing protocols
and detailed definitions.

## Communication Model
Peers are connected via a terminating reliable broadcast mechanism, e.g., a server receiving
protocol messages from each peer and forwarding them to all other peers. The broadcast mechanism is
responsible for ensuring that the same protocol message is forwarded to all other peers and for
notifiying the other peers when a peer has failed to send a protocol message in time.

Even if not strictly necessary, it is recommended that the peers communicate to the broadcast
mechanism via a channel that provides confidentiality, authentication of the broadcast mechanism,
and anonymity on the network level (i.e., unlinkability of sender and network identifiers such as
IP addresses). This can be achieved by a broadcast mechanism reachable via a Tor Hidden Service.

## Security Goals
A P2P mixing protocol provides two security guarantees.

 * Sender-Message Unlinkability

 An attacker controlling the network (including the broadcast mechanism) and some peers is not able
 to tell which input message belongs to which honest peer. In more detail, define the anonymity set
 of an individual honest peer's message to be the set of all honest peers who have not been
 excluded for being offline. Then the case that peer `p1` has sent input message `m` is
 computationally indistinguishable from the case that peer `p2` has sent message `m` for all peers
 `p1` and `p2` in the anonymity set.

 * Termination

 If the network (including the broadcast mechanism) is reliable and there are at least two honest
 peers, the protocol eventually terminates successfully for every honest peer.

## Protocol

### Setup Assumptions
TODO: Write

### Building Blocks

#### Pseudorandom Generator
 * `new_prg(seed)` initializes a PRG with seed `seed` and tweak `tweak`.
 * randomness can be obtained using calls such as `prg.get_bytes(n)` or `prg.get_field_element()`.

#### Non-interactive Key Exchange
We need a non-interactive key exchange protocol secure in the CKS model.
 * `(kesk, kepk) := new_ke_keypair(rand)` generates a secret key and a public key.
 We assume that for every valid public key there is a unique corresponding secret key.
 (Note: For ECDH, this implies that setting `kepk` to be just the x-coordinate without an
 additional bit is not sufficient; `kepk` must determine the full curve point.)
 * `validate_kepk(kepk)` outputs `true` iff `kepk` is a valid public key.
 * `shared_secret(kesk, kepk, my_id, their_id, tweak)` derives the shared secret between party
 `my_id` with secret key `kesk` and `their_id` with public key `kepk`, using the tweak `tweak`

#### Hash Functions
 * `hash` is a cryptographic hash function with output length `2k`.
 * `hash_short` is a cryptographic hash function with output length `k`.

Both hash functions are modeled as random oracles.

### Pseudocode Conventions
 * The (non-excluded) peers are stored in set `P`.
 * `sgn(x)` is the signum function.
 * `**` denotes exponentiation.
 * `^` denotes bitwise XOR.
 * `(o)` denotes the arithmetic operator `o` in the finite field, e.g., `(+)` is addition in
 the finite field.
 * String constants such as `"KE"` are symbolic, their actual representation as bytes is
 defined below.
 * Every peer `p` signs all its messages using the respective long-term signing key `p.ltsk`.
 The signatures are omitted in the pseudocode for readability. A peer who receives an incorrectly
 signed message is immediately treats the sending peer as offline and discards the message.

### Security

#### Sender-Message Unlinkability
The security argument is similar to the one presented for the [original DiceMix protocol][dicemix].

Note: It is crucial that for every run, every peer either starts confirmation with another peer, or
reveals the shared key with the other peer (where revealing the key exchange secret key is
equivalent to revealing shared keys with everybody). This holds true, because before starting
confirmation, only shared keys with peers not involved in confirmation are revealed, and after
starting confirmation, shared keys (and the key exchange secret key) are not revealed.

#### Termination
For termination, we assume that the broadcast mechanism is honest, i.e., it delivers messages
correctly and it does not equivocate.

The honest peers, who are assumed to receive the same messages, hold by construction the same state
in their consensus-critical public variables and take the same consensus-critical control flow
decisions, unless an honest peer fails with "One of my own messages in missing". This failure
happens only with negligible probability for an honest peer, because this requires the attacker to
find a second preimage of the message hash of the honest peer.

By correctness of the protocol, a protocol run terminates if every peer sends expected messages and
there is no message hash collision (and thus no slot collision). Consequently we can distinguish
two cases if the protocol fails.
  1. *There is a peer who has failed to send an expected message at least once.*

  The honest peers exclude this peer by construction.

  2. *There is a message hash collision but no peer involved in the message hash collision has
  failed to send an expected message.*

  We show that then all peers involved in the message hash collision are malicious with
  overwhelming probability.

  First, if only one peer is involved in the message hash collision (i.e., the peer sends the same
  message hash for multiple slot reservations), then this peer is obviously malicious with
  overwhelming probaility.

  Second, we consider the case that multiple peers are involved in a message hash collision. If one
  peer was honest, then the other peers involved in the collision could have derived the expected
  message of the honest user in the DC(KE) round of the previous run only with negligible
  probability; observe that they cannot have copied the honest peer's message hash either, because
  then their commitments would be expected only with negligible probability, as the commitments
  include the peer ID.

  Thus all peers involved in the message hash collision are malicious with overwhelming
  probability, and the honest peers exclude at least one such malicious peer.

In both cases, the honest peers exclude at least one disruptive, i.e., malicious or offline, peer.
Since all honest peers exclude the same disruptive peers, they all start the next run in the same
consensus-critical state. At some point, only honest peers will remain in the protocol execution
and the either protocol succeeds or fails expectly (in the case that only one peer remains).

### Possible Improvements

#### Smaller Field
To reduce the field size, it is possible to split the message hash in two halves, and send both halves
in different exponential DC-nets. Then only one of the DC-nets is used for slot reservation and the
other one is just used to verify integrity of the message. Peers must abort if their second half is not
present in the second DC-net, but it is not necessary to bind the two halves together, because the
number of combinations of left and right halves that the attacker can exploit is not too large.
Still the loss of security is quadratic in the number of mixed messages.

This can speed up the computation, because polynomial factorization in a 64-bit field is faster
than in a 128 bit field by more than a factor of 2 (at least in FLINT). Moreover, it is possible to
handle both DC-nets in parallel.

#### Only Sign the Key Exchange
In principle, it suffices to sign the key exchange messages. All other protocol messages do not
need to be authenticated for sender-message unlinkability. So if signature verification is a
bottleneck, then it is possible to drop the other signatures, which however adds complexity to the
protocol as well as its analysis by giving the attacker much more possibility to fiddle with the
protocol messages and reach possibly overlooked cases.
